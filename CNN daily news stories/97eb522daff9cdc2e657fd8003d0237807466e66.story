The owner of the plane was not among the passengers, but is in contact with the Coast Guard.

According to the fire department, the small aircraft was largely intact when rescue teams recovered it, but was badly damaged.

For six hours, divers continued to search the area with the help of two helicopters and seven boats.

Officials do not know the number of passengers who were aboard the plane and will continue the search until those facts become clear.
