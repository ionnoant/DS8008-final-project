A patient on PCP being taken to the hospital in Washington, DC Saturday morning, drove away in an ambulance called to transport him.

31-year-old Darren Ethedge was on the drug PCP when he was being transported to a local hospital around 9:30am Saturday morning.

Captured: The patient only got seven blocks before being pulled over by police

Ethedge only got seven blocks before police ordered him out of the vehicle and arrested him.

He now faces auto theft charges.
